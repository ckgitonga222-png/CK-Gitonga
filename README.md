Hey there! Iâ€™m Caroline, a curious mind on an exciting journey to become a front-end developer! ðŸš€

Right now, Iâ€™m learning the magic behind HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” and every new concept feels like unlocking a hidden level in a game ðŸŽ®.

I love experimenting with colors, layouts, and interactivity turning simple code into something that feels alive. âœ¨

Youâ€™ll probably catch me celebrating small wins like fixing my first bug or making a button actually do something ðŸ˜‚.
